# SafeShield 
## Introduction:
SafeShield, an **Intrusion Detection System (IDS) prototype** based on Deep Learning!
Our project is a simulation of threat detection, developed during our second year of Computer
Engineering bachelor as part of the Federated Project course.
As beginners passionate about cybersecurity, we embarked on this journey to delve deeper into
real-life threat detection scenarios and learn more about **SIEM (Security Information and Event
Management)**.
Our motivation was simple: to learn and share our knowledge! As a result, we proudly present
this project to fellow beginners and students eager to understand the basics of IDS.
